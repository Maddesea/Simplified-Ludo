# Simplified-Ludo
Welcome to my Ludo Game project!

This project is a simplified version of the classic board game Ludo. It allows two to four people to play. Each player has two tokens that start in their home yard. Players take turns rolling the dice to move their tokens clockwise along the track. A player can only move a token out of the home yard by rolling a 6. Rolling a 6 also earns the player an additional roll in that turn.

The goal of the game is to be the first player to have both of their tokens reach the finishing square. Additional rules include:

Landing on an opponent's token will send it back to its home yard
If a player's two tokens land on the same space, they will be stacked and moved as one
A decision-making algorithm is implemented to determine which token to move based on the roll and game state
An example game board can be seen in the Ludoboard.png file and below. Each player's start and end space numbers are different.

The project is implemented in Python.  Feel free to check out the code and play around with it. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
